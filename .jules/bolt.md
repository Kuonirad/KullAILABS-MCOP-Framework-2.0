## 2025-12-19 - [Pino Logger Payload Overhead]
**Learning:** Pino logger calls (e.g., `logger.debug`) evaluate their arguments even when the log level is disabled. This causes significant performance overhead if the arguments involve expensive computations like `JSON.stringify` or hashing.
**Action:** Always wrap expensive log payloads in `if (logger.isLevelEnabled('level'))` to ensure they are lazily evaluated.
