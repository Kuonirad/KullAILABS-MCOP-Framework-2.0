## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to the security of this framework and take all security vulnerabilities seriously.

### DO NOT Report Security Vulnerabilities Through Public GitHub Issues

Please email your findings to: **security@kullailabs-mcop.example.com**

### What to Include in Your Report

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, buffer overflow)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### PGP Encryption (Optional)

If you prefer to encrypt your communications, you may use PGP encryption. Contact us first to exchange public keys.

## Disclosure Policy

We adhere to a **90-day responsible disclosure policy**. When a report is received, we will:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** within 48 hours
2. **Confirm the vulnerability** within 7 days
3. **Investigate and develop a patch** within 30 days (for most issues)
4. **Coordinate public disclosure** with the researcher once a patch is released, or if the 90-day period elapses

### What We Promise

- We will respond to your report promptly
- We will keep you informed about our progress
- We will credit you (if desired) in our security advisories
- We will not take legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices

## Security Update Process

1. Security patches are released as soon as possible after verification
2. Critical vulnerabilities receive priority treatment
3. All security updates are documented in release notes
4. Users are notified through GitHub Security Advisories

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review Requirements

- All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Automated security scanning must pass

### Dependency Management

- Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities
- Dependabot is enabled for automatic security updates
- Lock files are committed to ensure reproducible builds

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Security Features

### Supply Chain Security

- GitHub Actions workflows use SHA-pinned dependencies
- Static Code Analysis (CodeQL) for JS/TS and Python
- Trojan Source detection is enabled
- SBOM generation for releases (planned)

### Runtime Security

- Content Security Policy headers (when deployed)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure defaults for all configurations
