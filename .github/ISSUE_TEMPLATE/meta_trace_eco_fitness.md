## 🧬 Meta-Trace Issue (Holographic Etch)

**Type:** Self-Referential Infrastructure
**Stigmergic Role:** The repository using its own principles to monitor and evolve itself
**Potency:** Maximum (enables all other traces to be measured and amplified)

---

### Description

Implement automated eco-fitness monitoring so the repository **becomes self-aware** of its ecological health. This creates a **stigmergic feedback loop**: the repo's structure modifies itself based on environmental measurements.

**Ecological Parallel:** Like trees releasing pheromones when under pest attack, the repo should signal its health status to attract contributors when bus factor drops or vulnerabilities emerge.

### Why This Matters (Holographic Perspective)

This is a **rank-1 holographic update** to the repo's meta-structure:
- Each commit → new measurement → new badge → attracts/repels contributors
- The measurement itself becomes a pheromone trace (JSON artifact)
- Creates **acausal coordination**: future contributors see current health without direct communication

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GitHub Action runs weekly + on every push/PR
- [x] Calculates all 5 eco-fitness factors (visibility, metabolic, resilience, biodiversity, succession)
- [x] Generates JSON report artifact (`.github/metrics/latest.json`)
- [x] Posts summary to GitHub Actions output
- [x] Commits updated metrics to main branch
- [ ] README badge displays current score (shield.io integration)
- [ ] Alerts when bus factor < 3 or vulnerabilities > 0

### Implementation Notes

**Already Completed:**
```yaml
.github/workflows/eco-fitness.yml - Automated monitoring
scripts/eco-fitness-audit.sh      - Local audit script
```

**Remaining Work:**
1. Add dynamic badge to README:
   ```markdown
   ![Eco-Fitness](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuonirad/KullAILABS-MCOP-Framework-2.0/main/.github/metrics/latest.json)
   ```

2. Create Shields.io endpoint schema in `latest.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "schemaVersion": 1,
     "label": "Eco-Fitness",
     "message": "72.75/100",
     "color": "green"
   }
   ```

3. Optional: Add GitHub Issue auto-creation when score drops >10 points

### Stigmergic Amplification

This meta-trace enables:
- **Positive feedback:** High scores attract more contributors → increases biodiversity → increases score
- **Negative feedback:** Low scores signal crisis → triggers intervention → prevents collapse
- **Temporal coordination:** Weekly measurements create rhythm (like circadian cycles in ecosystems)

### Success Metrics

- Eco-fitness score visible in README within 24 hours
- Weekly GitHub Action runs successfully for 4 consecutive weeks
- At least 1 contributor cites the eco-fitness score in their decision to contribute

**This issue contributes to:** Meta-level stigmergy (repo self-modification), Succession Stage (+15 points), Visibility (+10 points)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours (GitHub Action already exists, just needs badge integration)

**Tags:** `meta`, `automation`, `stigmergy`, `holographic-etch`, `self-referential`
