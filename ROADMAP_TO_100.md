---

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Triage (Weeks 1-4) → Target: 80/100

### Objective: Prevent Imminent Collapse

#### 1.1 Bus Factor Emergency (+15 points)
**New Brunswick Parallel:** When invasive species threaten keystone habitats, immediate intervention prevents cascading collapse.

**Actions:**
- [x] Create CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md (completed)
- [ ] Create 10 "Good First Issues" (use template)
- [ ] Recruit 2 consistent contributors (target: 10+ commits each in 30 days)
- [ ] Document all critical systems in ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Create rotation schedule for PR reviews

**Success Metric:** Bus factor ≥ 2.5 by week 4

#### 1.2 Stress Test Resilience (+5 points)
**NB Parallel:** Saint John River flood simulations predicted 2018 disaster. Test your repo before crisis hits.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Simulate maintainer absence: Freeze primary contributor commits for 1 week
- [ ] Introduce breaking dependency change (e.g., upgrade Next.js to 17 when released)
- [ ] Practice security incident response (intentionally add/remove mock CVE)
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

**Success Metric:** Ecosystem functions during 1-week primary maintainer absence

#### 1.3 Community Visibility (+10 points)
**NB Parallel:** Conservation efforts fail without public awareness. Make your repo discoverable.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Add comprehensive README with badges (build status, coverage, license)
- [ ] Publish to npm registry (even as experimental)
- [ ] Add repository topics: `typescript`, `next-js`, `stigmergy`, `collective-intelligence`
- [ ] Create Twitter/Mastodon account for updates
- [ ] Write blog post: "What is Stigmergy in Software?"

**Success Metric:** 50+ stars, 10+ forks by week 4

**Phase 1 Target Score:** 80/100

---

## 🌱 Phase 2: Diversification (Weeks 5-8) → Target: 90/100

### Objective: Build Resilient Community Structures

#### 2.1 Contributor Biodiversity (+15 points)
**NB Parallel:** Acadian Forest resilience requires species diversity beyond balsam fir monoculture.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Recruit contributors from 3+ different organizations
- [ ] Establish tiered contribution system:
  - Seedling (1-5 commits): 5 people
  - Sapling (6-20 commits): 3 people
  - Canopy (21-50 commits): 2 people
- [ ] Host virtual "contributor onboarding" workshop
- [ ] Create monthly "community calls" (async-friendly)
- [ ] Implement contributor recognition in README

**Success Metric:** Shannon Diversity Index ≥ 2.0 (vs. current 1.38)

#### 2.2 Ecosystem Services Expansion (+10 points)
**NB Parallel:** Healthy ecosystems provide multiple services (water filtration, carbon storage, recreation).

**Actions:**
- [ ] Add CI/CD badges and automated checks:
  - GitHub Actions for tests
  - Codecov for coverage tracking
  - Dependabot for security
  - CodeQL for vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Create plugin/extension system for third-party contributions
- [ ] Publish API documentation (TypeDoc or similar)
- [ ] Add example projects in `/examples` directory

**Success Metric:** 3+ external projects using this framework

#### 2.3 Trophic Level Definition (+5 points)
**NB Parallel:** Ecosystems need clear roles (predators, herbivores, decomposers).

**Actions:**
- [ ] Define clear roles in GOVERNANCE.md:
  - **Core Maintainers** (merge rights, architectural decisions)
  - **Reviewers** (PR approval, issue triage)
  - **Contributors** (code, docs, issues)
  - **Bots** (automated tasks)
- [ ] Establish voting process for major changes
- [ ] Create "emeritus maintainer" status for inactive keystones

**Success Metric:** 3 core maintainers, 5 regular reviewers

**Phase 2 Target Score:** 90/100

---

## 🏛️ Phase 3: Climax Community (Weeks 9-12) → Target: 100/100

### Objective: Achieve Antifragile Stability

#### 3.1 Longevity Proof (+5 points)
**NB Parallel:** Old-growth forests prove resilience through centuries of stress survival.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Survive 1 major breaking change (e.g., Next.js 17 migration)
- [ ] Recover from simulated security incident within 24 hours
- [ ] Maintain commit rate of 2-5/day for 60 consecutive days
- [ ] Close 80%+ of issues within 30 days for 2 months straight

**Success Metric:** No ecosystem collapse under stress

#### 3.2 Self-Sustaining Growth (+3 points)
**NB Parallel:** Mature forests regenerate without external intervention.

**Actions:**
- [ ] First external contributor becomes maintainer
- [ ] Documentation complete enough that new contributors need no 1:1 help
- [ ] Automated onboarding bot (@welcome-bot)
- [ ] Contributor-led features (not just maintainer-driven)

**Success Metric:** 50%+ commits from non-founding contributors

#### 3.3 Ecosystem Engineering (+2 points)
**NB Parallel:** Beavers actively shape wetland ecosystems. Your repo should do the same.

**Actions:**
- [ ] Upstream contributions to dependencies (Next.js, pino, etc.)
- [ ] Create educational content (YouTube tutorials, blog series)
- [ ] Spawn related projects (stigmergy-core library, CLI tool)
- [ ] Speak at conferences about stigmergy + collective intelligence

**Success Metric:** 3+ derivative projects, 2+ conference talks

**Phase 3 Target Score:** 100/100

## 🚨 Critical Path Milestones

### Week 4 Checkpoint: Bus Factor ≥ 2.5 ✅ or ❌
**If ❌:** Emergency protocol - pause new features, focus 100% on contributor onboarding

### Week 8 Checkpoint: Shannon Diversity ≥ 2.0 ✅ or ❌
**If ❌:** Reassess incentive structure - consider bounties, co-authorship offers

### Week 12 Checkpoint: 100/100 Score ✅ or ❌
**If ❌:** Identify bottleneck (visibility? contributor experience? technical debt?)

---

## 📈 Projected Score Trajectory

```
Week 0:  72.75 (Baseline)
Week 4:  80.00 (Triage Complete)
Week 8:  90.00 (Diversified Community)
Week 12: 100.00 (Climax Ecosystem)
```

## 🧬 Ecological Innovations

### Novel Strategies Inspired by NB Crisis:

1. **Assisted Migration** (Like moving tree species north for climate adaptation)
   - Actively recruit contributors from warmer ecosystems (Python, Rust communities)
   - Cross-pollinate ideas from other frameworks (Langchain, AutoGPT)

2. **Fire Ecology** (Controlled burns prevent catastrophic wildfires)
   - Scheduled "deprecation sprints" to remove tech debt
   - Regular "chaos engineering" tests (break things on purpose)

3. **Keystone Species Reintroduction** (Like wolves to Yellowstone)
   - Recruit domain expert in swarm intelligence
   - Bring in security researcher for adversarial testing

## ⚠️ Failure Modes & Mitigation

### Scenario A: Can't Recruit Contributors
**Risk:** Stay at 45/100 biodiversity forever
**Mitigation:**
- Offer co-authorship on papers
- Provide conference travel stipends
- Create paid internship program

### Scenario B: Growth Too Fast (Eternal September)
**Risk:** Low-quality contributions overwhelm maintainers
**Mitigation:**
- Strict CI requirements (must pass all tests)
- Required PR template with checklist
- Mentorship bottleneck (1 mentor per 3 new contributors)

### Scenario C: Founding Team Burnout
**Risk:** Ecosystem collapse before diversification
**Mitigation:**
- Implement "rotation sabbaticals" (1 week off per month)
- Automate 80% of maintenance (bots for triage, formatting, releases)
- Hire part-time community manager
